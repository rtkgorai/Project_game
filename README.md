Rules:The rules of the "Guess the Number" game are as simple as a cup of tea:
    The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range.
    The player attempts to guess the selected number .
    After each guess, the player receives feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
    The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the number .
    The game ends when the player either guesses the number.
    The player can choose to play the game again if they wish.
    At last the player get final score according to the condition i.e. 
    if he/she guessses the number in less than or equal to 5 tries he/she get 2 points 
    or number of guesses become greater than  5 but lower than 10 gets 1 point 
    or if guesses become greater than 10 then 1 point will be deducted.




Game:Stone, Paper or Scissors

Create a simple command-line game of "Stone, Paper, Scissors" using Python. This classic game allows two players i.e. you and computer to choose from three options: stone, paper, or scissors. The game determines the winner based on predefined rules: stone beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats stone.Features:

User Input: The game should prompt players to enter their choice (stone, paper, or scissors) through the command line.

Computer Opponent: Implement a computer opponent that randomly selects one of the three options.

Game Logic: Determine the winner based on the game rules and display the outcome to the players.
